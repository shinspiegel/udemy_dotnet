# This is a little playground

I was trying to understand and create a little API from Udemy content. Everything I did learn from that course was applying on this simples backend API.

I have a long run to learn everything on this framework, still I'm liking very much all the new stuff and the way of doing thing on the dotnet.

Hope you like it, any questions send me a DM on twitter.
